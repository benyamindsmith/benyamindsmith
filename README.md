Welcome to my Github profile!

I specialize in all things related to data engineering and data science, but I also like to learn other things as well. Alot of my commits are to private repositories so if you see a lacking of green squares that is likely the reason. I share what I learn here, but for a more coherent look check out [my website](https://bensstats.wordpress.com) where I share my insights in blog form.
